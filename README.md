## What is LikesTV?

LikesTV is a website that lets you view Twitch TV live streams based on video games you've liked on Facebook. You'll also be able to filter out any specific games you don't wish to see in your channels list.

LikesTV uses the FuelPHP framework for PHP coding and Twitter Bootstrap for styling. It also uses the Facebook SDK and Twitch TV "Kraken" API.

LikesTV is now live as of 2013/08/28! You can access the site at [LikesTV](http://likestv.gopagoda.com/). Users will be able to login with their Facebook account and see recommended channels of their "liked" games. They can also filter out any games they do not wish to include in their recommendations. A contact page is also available in case users need to reach LikesTV support.

Any issues found or suggestions should be emailed directly to davidchao@fullsail.edu for the fastest response time. Any bug reports should include steps to recreate your issue, expected result, and a screenshot.
